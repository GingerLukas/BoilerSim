# BoilerSim

This project uses dynamic simulation to accomplish the set goal.

## Simulation
Simulation is split between 4 steps
1. Init (reset state from previous step)
2. Request (make requests to suplier nodes based on node and node's consumers needs)
3. Dedicate (dedicate available water to consumer nodes who requested it)
4. Final (calculate final volume and temperature)
